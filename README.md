# Sub-Freqs

Analyses the frequency of words in subtitles and compares to SUBTLEX-UK.
The files should be .srt format, and can be passed individually, or as a folder.
If passed as a folder, only .srt files in the root directory will be analysed; no subdirectories.

# Usage

python srt_freqs.py filepath.srt
python srt_freqs.py folderpath
